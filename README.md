## Online CV by Ralph Martin Granados

### :information_source: Background
Started as a project to take all I've learned from Udemy Course: [The Complete 2022 Web Development Bootcamp](https://www.udemy.com/course/the-complete-web-development-bootcamp/) by @angelabauer to create my first online cv.

Now I maintain it to keep the content information up to date. As soon as I gain new web knowledge, I then try to incorporate it here. Making this my web knowledge repository of sort. I try to keep it strictly vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, but using basic frameworks such as Bootstrap 5, and Jquery is unavoidable.
